# MPI Implementation to solve the 2-Dimensional Laplace problem using Jacobi iteration method


The theoretical information about the problem can be fount in 
```
ParallelProgr-MPI.pdf  
``` 

## Task 1
Implement a working version of this algorithm (remember that you can assume that *m* is divisible by *N*). The code must be properly documented. You must include all the necessary information for running your code and indicate the test cases you have used.
