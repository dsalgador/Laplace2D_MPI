# Tasks

## Task 1
Implement a working version of this algorithm (remember that you can assume that *m* is divisible by *N*). The code must be properly documented. You must include all the necessary information for running your code and indicate the test cases you have used.

## Task 2

Implement a working version of one of these mechanisms (you can make assumptions about the matrix dimensions [m, n] and the number of processes N if needed). You must justify your selection, which means that you must discuss the perceived pros and cons of all methods. The code must be properly documented. You must include all the necessary information for running your code and indicate the test cases you have used.


## Task 3

Make a performance anlysis of your program versions using the given hints and the support of the performance analysis tools available in the lab. You must present an organized explanation of this analysis.
